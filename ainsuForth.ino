// BUG: code paste fails.  Same code typed by hand
// more likely to succeed.  Short paste-ins do not fail.

// It is as though the system tries to keep up with the
// speed of the uploaded paste-in, and does well for a
// while, but gets overrrun.

// ATTEMPT: sprinkle 'static' or 'volatile' like paprika on the code.


// ASCII_NL will echo. (see getkey.cpp)

// .s word -- reverse collated; gforth style delimiter

// , 2drop c! - three words added to dictionary.
